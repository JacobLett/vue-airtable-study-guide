## About Me - Junior Dev for Life

I learn best by looking at the code others have written and building things.

In my own learning journey I have often been frustrated with the lack of simple, to-the-point code examples. 

Rather, there seems to be an over-abundance of lengthy tutorials that often teach too many things to absorb effectively.

The short projects I publish are my attempt to provide succinct illustrations of a handful of new concepts along with a few ideas on how to practice.

Any and all constructive feedback and requests are very welcome.
